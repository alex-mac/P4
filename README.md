# P4 
The final project created as a capstone for the cohort. THis is a full-stack application with Angular.js for the front end, MongoDB for the backend, and self-created APIs for the users and .  Developed over the course of a week, P4 aims to encapsulate the main ideas of the cohort: full RESTful routing on the APIs, full CRUD functionality (without the ability to edit data because in practice, data should be generated), and semantic HTML and CSS.
